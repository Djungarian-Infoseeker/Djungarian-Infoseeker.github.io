## 个人/For Me

I am currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Marine Science at the College of Ocean and Earth Sciences, Tongji University. In September 2025, I will begin my studies at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University, where I will be conducting research in planetary climatology. I am also currently participating in an exchange program at Tokyo University of Science (formerly known as Tokyo Institute of Technology) in Tokyo, Japan.

I was born and raised in Yangquan, an industrial and mining city in Shanxi Province, northern China, which flourished during the latter half of the 20th century. Over the years, I have also lived for extended periods in Taiyuan, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tokyo. I graduated from Yangquan No. 1 High School, which is known for having nurtured prominent figures such as the science fiction writer Liu Cixin and Baidu's CEO Robin Li. At Tongji University, after thoughtful deliberation, I chose to focus my advanced studies on climate dynamics, with a particular passion for planetary climatology. I am fascinated by this interdisciplinary field, which is rich with the complexities of systems theory.
